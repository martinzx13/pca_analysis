dataset and a brief description of the observed variables will be sent by email.

1. Make a preliminary analysis of the data and discuss what you have learned from this analysis.
2. Conduct a principal component analysis exploring the potentialities of this method. Include in your
discussion topics like dimensionality reduction, interpretation of principal components.
