Abstract
Air quality is known to be a key factor in affecting the wellbeing and quality of life of the general populous and there is a
large body of knowledge indicating that certain underrepresented groups may be overexposed to air pollution. Therefore, a
more precise understanding of air pollution exposure as a driving cause of health disparities between and among ethnic
and racial groups is necessary. Utilizing 52,613 urban census tracts across the United States, this study investigates age,
racial, educational attainment and income differences in exposure to benzene pollution in 1999 as a case. The study
examines spatial clustering patterns of these inequities using logistic regression modeling and spatial autocorrelation
methods such as the Global Moran’s I index and the Anselin Local Moran’s I index. Results show that the age groups of 0 to
14 and those over 60 years old, individuals with less than 12 years of education, racial minorities including Blacks, American
Indians, Asians, some other races, and those with low income were exposed to higher levels of benzene pollution in some
census tracts. Clustering analyses stratified by age, education, and race revealed a clear case of disparities in spatial
distribution of exposure to benzene pollution across the entire United States. For example, people aged less than 4 years
from the western south and the Pacific coastal areas exhibit statistically significant clusters. The findings confirmed that
there are geographical-location based disproportionate pattern of exposures to benzene air pollution by various sociodemographic factors across the United States and this type of disproportionate exposure pattern can be effectively
detected by a spatial autocorrelation based cluster analysis method. It is suggested that there is a clear and present need for
programs and services that will reduce inequities and ultimately improve environmental conditions for all underrepresented
groups in the United States.

Exposure to air pollution, however, may vary spatially within a
city [6] and these variations may follow social gradients that
influence susceptibility to environmental exposures [7]. Residents
of poorer neighborhoods may live closer to point sources of
industrial pollution or roadways with higher traffic density [8].
International research has shown that air pollution exposure varies
by socio-economic status, with lower socio-economic groups being
disproportionately exposed to air pollution and to environmental
mechanisms that lead to inequities in health [9]. For example,
there is consistent evidence in California that patterns of
disproportionate exposure to air pollution among minority and
lower-income communities exists [10]. These communities also
face other challenges associated with low socioeconomic status,
including psychosocial stressors, which make it more difficult to
cope with these exposures [9].
Meanwhile, although current research has confirmed the
relations between social-demographic characteristics (e.g., education, age, race etc.) and disease [11], they are still inadequate in
explaining the underlying reasons for disease disparities. Thus,

Introduction
Environmental injustice may be defined as a type of injustice
when a particular social group is disproportionately burdened with
environmental hazards [1]. The underlying contributors to
environmental injustices can be political, economic, historical,
and social [2].
Air pollution, the most common type of pollutant in environmental injustice studies, can be traced back to the industrialization-urbanization nexus beginning in the 19th century. Evidence
indicates that air pollution exposure is more serious than
previously thought, in terms of adverse health impacts such as
reduced life expectancy, increased daily mortality and hospital
admissions, birth outcomes, and asthma [3]. These effects have
been shown to exist in both economically developing and
developed countries [4]. Systematic efforts to control air pollution
and to protect public health commenced mostly in the second half
of the 20th century and have intensified since the 1960s [5].

further understanding of the role of socio-demographic status as a
component of susceptibility to the adverse health effects of air
pollution is necessary in the process of setting ambient air quality
standards and implementing programs and policy that lead to
adherence to these standards.

Today, air pollution is still a major environmental health issue
in the United States, directly affecting people’s wellbeing and
quality of life with adverse health impacts such as excess
respiratory, cardiovascular morbidity and higher mortality [12].

this way, a broader understanding of the causes of population
health disparities by race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, and

geographic location is necessary for achieving better solutions to
population health problems caused by the complex cocktail of air
pollution found in the United States. This study aims to investigate

particularly suitable for environmental justice research, not only
because they allow researchers to estimate the potential health
risks associated with specific environmental hazards and analytical
spatial units, but also because the data modeling takes into account
a number of factors such as wind speed, wind direction, air
turbulence, smokestack height and the rate of chemical decay and
deposition [18]. Another important advantage of the NATA data
is their spatial compatibility with socio-demographic census data:
the modeled risk estimates are available for census units (e.g.,
tracts), which also include demographic characteristics of residential population.
The annual benzene pollution concentration for census tracts
was used to represent air pollution. Benzene is a ubiquitous
chemical in the environment that causes acute leukemia and
probably other hematological cancers [19]. Meanwhile, recent
studies reported an association between higher benzene exposure
concentrations with lower social economy status and social class
[20], [21]. While other air pollutants (e.g. sulfur dioxide) have
experienced a downward trend in use over the past few decades,
benzene is still one of the key toxic air pollutants produced by
today’s petrochemical industry and can be found in gasoline
petroleum tanks throughout urban areas. Benzene exposure data
from 1999 NATA have been utilized for air pollution exposure
equity analysis [22], [23]. We calculated county level mean
exposure concentration values based on exposure concentrations
of census tracts (Fig. 2). Because recent studies have focused on the
effects of continuous exposure to low concentrations of benzene
[24], [25], [26], we used a ‘relative exposure level’ metric to
evaluate benzene pollution exposure inequities in this study [27].
In this way, population in census tracts with exposure concentrations higher than a county level mean exposure concentration
value are recognized as ‘high’ exposure concentration, whereas as
low exposure concentration is assigned to census tracts below
average.
The population data at census tract and county levels in this
study were retrieved from the US Census 2000 Summary File 1
[28], while the geographic boundaries of spatial scale were
acquired from the Census 2000 Topologically Integrated Geographic Encoding and Referencing (TIGER)/Line dataset [29].
Following previous studies [30], [31], [32], [33], we selected age,
race, educational attainment, and income as the socio-demographic indicators in this study. These characteristics were

census tract level exposure to air pollution by these factors and to
examine the spatial clustering patterns of the disparities at county
level.

Data and Methods
Study Area
This study focuses on all urban census tracts within the United
States, which is further classified into four census regions (e.g.
Northeast, Midwest, West, South), and nine divisions [14]. This
regional and divisional classification, as defined by the United
States Census Bureau, is based upon factors such as employment,
crime, health, consumer expenditures, and housing. The demographic differences between these divisions are suitable to be
utilized for analyzing the air pollution exposure inequities across
the entire country. We chose to use census tracts because this was
the smallest level of aggregation at which air quality information
for benzene was available and it was generally utilized as the
standard spatial scale for environmental justice studies due to its
relatively homogeneous characteristics relative to socio-demographic status and living conditions [15], [16]. The study area
consists of an aggregate number of 64,890 census tracts, 3,109
counties within 48 contiguous states and Washington DC. The
number of counties included in our study is 29 for New England
(Division 1), 81 for Mid-Atlantic (Division 2), 174 for East North
Central (Division 3), 187 for West North Central (Division 4), 214
for South Atlantic (Division 5), 97 for East South Central (Division
6), 194 for West South Central (Division 7), 101 for Mountain
(Division 8), and 69 for Pacific (Division 9) (Fig. 1). After filtering
out rural census tracks, we were left with 52,613 urban census
tracts that account for 80.5% of the total 64,890 census tracts in
the United States.

Data Sources and Analysis
The Environmental Hazard Data were ascertained from the US
Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) NATA (National Air
Toxics Assessments) website [17]. The NATA data is the EPA’s
ongoing comprehensive evaluation of air toxics in the U.S. EPA
developed the NATA as a state-of-the-science screening tool for
state, local, and tribal agencies to prioritize pollutants, emission
sources, and locations of interest and for researchers to gain a
better understanding of environmental risks. These datasets are

whether the environmental inequities were caused by the
interactions among these different global scale spatial autocorrelations. Logistic regression modeling was used to calculate the
ORs. Finally, local hotpot detection was employed to pinpoint the
statistically significant hot spots or cluster areas based on the ORs
of counties. The methodological principles and implementation
details of these sub-processes are described as follows:
1. Global autocorrelation analysis. At present, there are
many ways to test the global autocorrelations of events. The most
popular one among them is Moran’s I statistic, which has been
used to test the null hypothesis that the spatial autocorrelation of a
variable is zero [36], [37]. If the null hypothesis is rejected, the
variable would be considered spatially autocorrelated. Moran’s I
statistic of spatial autocorrelation is presented by Cliff and Ord
1981 as formulas (1–2) [38]:

categorized into different levels based on the reference categories
of existing studies [34] (Table 1). We reclassified the census tract
level individual incomes into high or low levels (groups) by using
the computed national wide median income values as standards.
Population in census tracts with income values higher than the
nation-wide median income value were categorized in the ‘high’
income group, whereas the ‘low income’ group was assigned to
census tracts below that national average. Figure 3 shows the
population percentiles based on socio-demographic characteristics
in the nine divisions. It can be seen that the socio-demographic
characteristics including age, race, education attainment, and
income fluctuate significantly across the nine divisions. This again
emphasizes the necessity of conducting demography-based analysis of air pollution exposure inequities.

Spatial autocorrelation is an optimal method for systematically
ascertaining spatial patterns of air pollution exposure inequities
[35]. For the purpose of detecting spatial clusters of environmental
inequity across the United States, the spatial cluster analytical
strategy used in this study is designed to include three subprocesses, including global autocorrelation analysis, logistic
regression modeling, and local hot spot detection. Since we are
interested in spatial patterns based on a large data set in the study
area, it is reasonable that spatial dependence exists at the global
scale because of the continuous characteristic of terrain in
developed or open areas. Global autocorrelation analysis is
therefore adopted to preliminarily explore the spatial autocorrelations of benzene pollution concentration as well as sociodemographic indicators. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated for
each county across the entire study area to further diagnose

In this study, we use the census tract as the base spatial unit.

United States and each Division separately. The analyses were
conducted using the ‘Spatial Statistic Tools’ in ArcGIS 10.0.
2. Logistic regression modeling. Logistic regression is a
mathematical modeling technique that describes the relationship
between several independent variables and a dichotomous
dependent variable [39]. Most environmental justice studies use
logistic regression to derive ORs based on the following formulas
(3–8):
odds~P=(1{P)

ð3Þ

log (odds)~ log it(P)~ ln½P=(1{P)

ð4Þ

ln½P=(1{P)~azbX

OR~½P1 =ð1{ P1 Þ=½P2 =ð1{ P2 Þ

ð8Þ

where ‘odds’ is the probability of the dichotomous dependent
variable equals an event (i.e. the case or control group being
exposed to air pollution) (i.e., ‘p’) divided by the probability of the
event not to occur (i.e., ‘p/1-p’). OR denotes odd ratio, indicating
the relative value by which the ‘odds’ of the outcome increases
(i.e., OR greater than 1.0) or decreases (i.e., OR less than 1.0). ‘e’ is
the exponential constant, equal to 2.71828. ‘P1’ denotes the
probability of the case group being exposed to air pollution. ‘P2’
denotes the probability of the control or reference group being
exposed to air pollution. ‘X’ represents the explanatory variables
which are either interval-level or ‘dummy’, a, b represents partial
regression coefficients of the independent variable ‘X’.
The logistic regression modeling in this study was implemented
in SPSS version 17. In this process, the census tract level benzene
pollution concentration was dichotomized as the dependent
variable and coded as either ‘1’ (i.e. above) or ‘0’ (i.e. below)
based on the mean concentrations at the county level. Consequently, age, race, educational attainment, and income were
selected as independent variables and recoded (e.g., the reference
category was coded as ‘0’). Meanwhile, the population amount of
above/below pollution concentrations in each category by
different socio-demographic indicators were input correspondingly
as weight cases while the ‘indicator option’ in SPSS was set first as
the reference category. In addition, we assess whether there is any
significant relationship between the dependent variable Y (i.e.
benzene pollution concentration) and independent variables X
(socio-demographic indicators). More specifically, if any of the null
hypotheses that b = 0 is valid, then X is statistically insignificant in
the logistic regression model. However, it was difficult for us to
eliminate the potential bias of the logistic regression modeling for
each type of demographic variable (e.g., age) by inputting the
remaining variables (e.g., race, education attainment, income) as
confounding factors, because the attribute values for those
variables were aggregated values rather than individual level ones.

autocorrelation is detected, the question about how to identify

more local patterns emerges. This leads to the challenge of finding
an appropriate test for local spatial autocorrelations in the
presence of global spatial autocorrelation. Local Moran’s I based
cluster mapping has been suggested as an effective method in
detecting the hot spots or cluster areas of environmental exposure
inequity based on spatial autocorrelation theory [40]. Formulas
(9–11) present the basic principle of local Moran’s I statistic.

where the designations for the letters such as n, xi, xj, X are similar
to those in formulas 3–8, Si is the deviation between an attribute
value at spatial unit i and its mean X , Ii is the Moran’s I index
which indicates the extent to which neighboring spatial units
congregate with each other in terms of attributes. If the attribute
values in the dataset tend to cluster spatially (i.e., high values near
high values; low values near low values), the Moran’s I index will
be positive. When high values repel other high values, or tend to
be near low values, the index value will be negative. If the values in
the dataset tend to scatter spatially, the index will be near zero.
The range of the index value falls between 21.0 and +1.0 [40].

We utilized cluster and outlier analysis (Anselin Local Moran’s
I) functions in ‘Spatial Statistic Tools’ within ArcGIS 10.0 to
identify the local hot spots or cluster areas of benzene exposure
inequity in this study. In this process, x is the OR value of each
county. wij is determined based on the adjacency standard, where
wij = 1 when there is a shared side between adjacent two counties,
and 0 otherwise. The significance of the hot spots or cluster areas
is determined by the Z-score and P value. That is, a high positive
Z-score for benzene exposure inequities of a county with P value at
0.05 level indicates the surrounding features have the either high
or low OR values (i.e., High-high, or Low-low). Inversely, a low
negative Z-score for benzene exposure inequities of a county with
P value at 0.05 level indicates a significant spatial outlier (i.e.,
High-low, or Low-high).

Spatial Clustering of Air Pollution Exposure Inequity by
Race
Table 4 delineates frequency of ORs greater than 1 by race
characteristic at the county level in the United States and the nine
divisions. It can be seen that racial minorities such as Blacks,
American Indians, and Asians were exposed to higher levels of
benzene pollution in some counties. For Blacks, Division 1 had the
highest proportion (86.2%), followed by Division 3 (77.6%) and
Division 2 (75.3%). The smallest proportion for Blacks was found
in Division 8 (54.5%). For American Indians, Division 1 had the
highest proportion (65.5%), followed by Division 9 (56.5%) and
Division 3 (51.7%). The smallest proportion for American Indians
was found in Division 6 and Division 7 (30.9%). For Asians,
Division 1 had the highest proportion (82.8%), followed by
Division 2 (77.8%) and Division 6 (70.1%). The smallest
proportion for Asians was found in Division 7 (44.3%). For other
races, Division 1 showed the highest level of exposure with (86.2%)
followed by Divisions 9 and 3 (82.6%; 81.0%). The lowest
exposure in this racial group was in Division 5 (61.7%). It could
also be observed that the proportion of counties exposed to higher
levels of benzene pollution by divisions is mostly more than 50%
for the United States and the nine divisions, except for the
American Indians in Divisions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 and Asians in
Division 7.
Figure 5 shows the county level clusters of benzene pollution
exposure inequity based on the results from Table 5. High-risk
areas for Blacks were found in Divisions 3, 4, 5, 6, 9, which
included the number of spatial cluster county units of 5, 3, 1, 3, 2
respectively (Fig. 5A). Figure 5B shows the high-risk clusters for
American Indians. These cluster areas are mainly located in
Divisions 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, which included the number of spatial
cluster county units is 2, 1, 6, 2, 3, 7 respectively. High-risk spatial
cluster areas for Asians are located in Divisions 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, with
spatial cluster county units of 2, 4, 8, 1, 2, and 1 (Fig. 5C). Highrisk spatial cluster areas of other races are located in Divisions 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 7, 9, which included the spatial cluster county units of 3, 3,
3, 10, 1, 11, and 4 respectively(Fig. 5D).

Results
Global Autocorrelation Analysis of Air Pollution Exposure
Table 2 delineates the values derived from the Global
autocorrelation calculation for the nine divisions and the entire
United States. With Global Moran’s I index, people aged less than
4 years from Divisions 7 (0.090) and 9 (0.110) exhibit statistically
significant clusters and have larger positive index values than the
entire United States (0.046). Furthermore, even though Global
Moran’s I index values for Asians with educational attainment of
9-12 years appeared not to be statistically significant for the United
States, Asians for Divisions 2, 4 and 5 (0.120, 0.054, 0.044), and
education level of 9-12 years for Divisions 7 and 9 (0.058, 0.195)
show significant cluster patterns.

Spatial Clustering of Air Pollution Exposure Inequity by
Age
Table 3 delineates frequency of ORs greater than 1 by age
characteristic at the county level in the United States and by the
nine divisions. From Table 3, it can be seen that people belonging
to age groups 0 to 14 and 60+ years old were exposed to higher
levels of benzene pollution in some counties across the United
States. For the age group of 60 years and older, Division 6 had the
highest proportion (58.8%), followed by Division 2 (54.3%) and
Division 7 (47.4%). The smallest proportion for that age group was
found in Division 9 (34.8%). For the age group of 0–14, Division 9
displayed the greatest exposure (43.5%) followed by Divisions 7
and 1 (40.7%; 31.0% respectively). Division 8 has the lowest
exposure in that age group (10.9%). We also observed that the
proportion of counties exposed to higher levels of benzene
pollution by division is mostly less than 50% for the United States
and the nine divisions, except for the age group of 60 years and
older in Divisions 2 and 6.
Figure 4 delineates the county level spatial clusters of benzene
pollution exposure inequity based on data from Table 3. From
Figure 4, the high-risk areas for the age group of 0–14 are located
in Divisions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9, which includes the number of
spatial cluster county units of 1, 2, 2, 2, 6, 2 respectively (Fig. 4A).
Figure 4B shows high-risk areas for people age 60 years and over.
It can be seen that these clusters were mainly located in Divisions
2–4 and 6–8, which includes the number of spatial cluster county
units, which was 4, 7, 2, 7, 4, 2 respectively.

Spatial Cluster of Air Pollution Exposure Inequity by
Education
Table 5 delineates frequency of ORs greater than 1 by education
characteristic at the county level in the United States and the nine
divisions. Results indicate that individuals with less than 12 years
education were exposed to higher levels of benzene pollution in
some counties of the United States. For those with less than 4 years
education, Division 2 had the highest proportion (75.3%), followed
by Division 9 (66.7%) and Division 1 (65.5%). The smallest
proportion for this same education group was found in Division 6
(44.3%). For the education level of 5 to 8 years, Division 1 had the
highest proportion (75.9%), followed by Division 9 (68.1%) and
Division 2 (63.0%). The smallest proportion for this education
group was found in Division 6 (35.1%). For the education level of
9 to 12 years, Division 1 bore the greatest exposure with (72.4%)
followed by Divisions 2 (63.0%) and 3 (62.1%). The lowest
exposure for this age group was in Division 6 (45.4%). We also

Spatial Cluster Detection of Exposure Inequities

disparities between 1990 and 1998 [41], some divisions have
reported an increase in disparities during the same period [42].
Marshall [34] found environmental inequities of air pollution
exposure in California’s South Coast Air Basin, which persisted
even after accounting for covariates such as population density,
travel distance, mean differences between whites and nonwhites
were 16–40% among the five pollutants.
A unique insight of this current study is that it highlighted
spatial clusters of air pollution exposure inequity by race. Previous
studies have shown that hazardous waste and industrial facilities
were commonly located in or close to communities with
populations that are of disproportionately higher proportions of
minority or low-income individuals [43]. Our study extends the
findings of previous studies by incorporating the spatial perspective
of these inequities.
Minority neighborhoods tend to have higher rates of mortality,
morbidity, and are more likely to be influenced by health risk
factors than white neighborhoods, even after accounting for
economic and other characteristics [44]. According to Gee and
Takeuchi [45], differential residential locations come with
differential levels of exposure to health risks. In particular,
neighborhood stressors and pollution sources are related to
adverse health conditions, which are counterbalanced by neighborhood resources. When community stressors and pollution
sources outweigh neighborhood resources, levels of community
stress manifest or increase. Community stress is a state of
ecological vulnerability that may translate into individual stressors,
which in turn may lead to individual stress. Individual stress may
then make individuals more vulnerable to illness when they are
exposed to environmental hazards. Furthermore, compromises in
individual and community health may further weaken community
resources, leading to a vicious cycle [46].
In addition, a key finding in our study is the significant
inequities of air pollution exposure by educational attainment and
income in the United States. For educational attainment based
inequities, the results followed those of a previous study of 20 US
cities which revealed strong (although not statistically significant)
associations between PM10 and mortality for less educated subjects
[47] as well as a study from Shanghai, China that showed an
association between lower education and greater impact of air
pollution-attributed mortality [48]. As to income attainment-based
inequities, although the income in most census tracts across United
States in this study exceeds the national poverty guideline for the

the education levels of 5 to 8 years in Divisions 4, 6, 7, 8 and the
education levels ranging from 9 to 12 years in Divisions 4, 6, 8.
Figure 6 shows the county levels inequality of benzene pollution
exposure based on information in Table 5. High-risk areas for
education level less than 4 years were located in Divisions 2, 3, 4,
5, 6, 7, which included the number of spatial cluster county units
of 1, 7, 2, 6, 1, 5, respectively (Fig. 6A). Figure 6B shows that highrisk areas for people of the 5–8 years of education level were
mainly located in Divisions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, which are associated
with spatial cluster county units of 8, 1, 1, 5, 15, 1, 3 respectively.
High-risk areas for education level between 9 and 12 years were
located in Divisions 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, which included the number of
spatial cluster county units of 10, 2, 2, 5, 6, 7 respectively (Fig. 6C).

Spatial Cluster of Air Pollution Exposure Inequity by
Income
Table 6 delineates frequencies of ORs greater than 1 by income
characteristics at the county level in the United States and by the
nine US Census Bureau divisions. From Table 6, it can be seen
that people belonging to low income groups were exposed to
higher levels of benzene pollution in some counties across the
United States. For the low-income group, Division 1 had the
highest proportion of residents with high exposure (65.5%),
followed by Division 2 (60.5%) and Division 3(42.5%). The
smallest proportion for the low-income group was found in
Division 7 (10.3%). We also observed that the proportion of
counties exposed to higher levels of benzene pollution by Division
is mostly less than 50% for the United States and the nine
divisions, except for the low-income group in Divisions 1 and 2.
Figure 7 details the county level spatial clusters of benzene
pollution exposure inequity based on data from Table 6. As shown
in Figure 7, the high-risk areas for the low-income groups are
located in Divisions 3, 4, 5 and 9, which include the number of
spatial cluster county units of 2, 1, 1, 2 respectively.

Discussion
This study is among the first spatial assessments of the inequities
of air pollution exposure across the entire continental United
States at the census tract scale. The results demonstrated that
disparities in benzene air pollution exposure could help explain
health disparities by age, race, educational attainment, and
income. Although there has been a national decrease in health

explain how or why race, age, educational attainment and income
interact to produce air pollution inequity.
Another limitation of our data source is that, in Canada and the
United States, census tracts are often referred to as a representation of the neighborhood [49]. However, it has been demonstrated that these census units do not represent underlying social
boundaries and may depict the artifacts of administrative rules of a
putative system [50]. Hence, it is sometimes difficult to tease out if
the results of the analysis are representative of the reality or if they
are the results of using a certain type of geographical unit [51].
To remedy the limitations of current studies, this paper
identifies a set of overarching recommendations. Based on our
results, scientists and community leaders should work in partnership to prioritize research needs, gather data, assess other air
pollutants beyond benzene, and test interventions that will
influence public policy in order to protect the health of all,
including those living in communities of color and places that are
economically deprived. Policy-makers can also enhance existing
services that assist vulnerable groups and/or susceptible individuals to help close the disparity of exposure.

same period, significant and large ORs were observed for counties
with relatively low income. This would indicate that people
belonging to low income groups were more likely to be exposed to
higher levels of benzene pollution in the United States relative to
their higher income counterparts.
It should be noted that as this study is fairly unique in the
methodology employed (e.g. spatial autocorrelation) for investigating environmental and socio-demographic inequities (geographic unit, methods of statistical analysis, exposure assessment
procedures and definition of deprivation), our results are difficult
to compare to other studies in relativistic terms. As more studies
using this type of methodology are performed, a more comprehensive comparison will be possible. However, the results provided
in this study would be highly applicable in other areas of research
such as causal analysis of disease clusters, environmental policy
targeting, and human rights policy making over large geographical
areas.
Similar to previous analyses, the results of this study must be
interpreted with caution. For example, since this study only
examined a single type of air pollutant (i.e. benzene), our findings
may not be generalizable to the cumulative effect of all other types
of air pollutants. Further, our racial disparity analysis was only
restricted to the classification of Blacks, American Indians, Asians
and ‘‘Other races’’. Thus, we do not know if the interactive
relationships uncovered here would hold true for Pacific Islanders
who were probably combined with Asians or whether the results
would change, which might make it be reasonable to identify
Pacific Islanders as ‘Other race’ in the categorization. This study
may also mask rural/urban characteristics when analyzing racial
inequities in air pollution exposure. Similar to other ecological
studies, this paper used aggregate data (e.g. census tract level) and
could not incorporate individual-level information such as
individual migration, time length of residence, and location
exposure differences between work, recreation and living. Finally,
as this study does not test any causal hypotheses, we could not

Conclusions
In summary, this study revealed that there are disproportionate
exposures to benzene air pollution by a range of factors including
age, race, education attainment and income in the United States.
Spatial autocorrelation was also shown to be a valuable tool in this
study to analyze how socio-demographic variables can influence
the spatial patterns of air pollution exposure. However, further
work is needed to inform policy-makers so that they can respond
to the challenges and expectations that will improve environmental conditions for all underrepresented groups in the United States
and beyond.
