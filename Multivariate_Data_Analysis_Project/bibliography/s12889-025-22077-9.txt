Abstract
Background Metabolic diseases (MDs), exemplified by diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, have become
increasingly prevalent with rising living standards, posing significant public health challenges. The MDs are influenced
by a complex interplay of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and socioeconomic conditions. Additionally, environmental
pollutants, particularly air pollutants (APs), have attracted increasing attention for their potential role in exacerbating
these MDs. However, the impact of APs on the MDs remains unclear. This study introduces a novel machine learning
(ML) pipeline, an Algorithm for Spatial Relationships Analysis between Exposome and Metabolic Diseases (ASEMD),
to analyze spatial associations between APs and MDs at the prefecture-level city scale in China.
Methods The ASEMD pipeline comprises three main steps: (i) Spatial autocorrelation between APs and MDs
is evaluated using Moran’s I statistic and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) maps. (ii) dimensionality
reduction and spatial similarities identification between APs and MDs clusters using Principal Component Analysis
(PCA), k-means clustering, and Jaccard index calculations, further validated through spatial maps. (iii) AP exposure
is adjusted by demographic and lifestyle confounders to predict MDs using machine learning models (e.g., eXtreme
Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), LightGBM, and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)).
SHAP values are employed to identify key adjusted APs that are linked to MDs. Model performance is evaluated
through 10-fold cross-validation using five different metrics. The data utilized include CHARLS (2015) and meteorological data (2013-2015).
Results Significant spatial correlations were found between APs and the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia,
and hypertension, with higher prevalence rates observed in alignment with elevated APs concentrations. By adjusting for demographic and lifestyle confounders, APs effectively predicted the risk of developing MDs (AUROC=0.890,
0.877, 0.710 for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, respectively). The results showed that CO , PM2.5, and AQI
were strongly correlated with diabetes, whereas NO2, PM2.5, and PM10 were significantly associated with dyslipidemia.
For hypertension, CO , O3, and AQI were mostly correlated. Sensitivity analyses across different regions and different
types of APs underscored the robustness of our conclusions.

Conclusion The ASEMD pipeline successfully integrates ML models, epidemiological methods, and spatial analysis
techniques, providing a robust framework for understanding the complex interactions between APs and MDs. We
also identified specific APs, including PM10, CO , and SO2, as being strongly linked to higher rates of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension in central and northern cities. Future region-specific public health strategies or interventions,
especially in those areas with high pollutant levels, are needed to mitigate air pollution’s impact on metabolic health.
Keywords Air Pollutant, Metabolic Disease, Machine Learning

Introduction
According to recent consensus, a wide range of diseases,
like hypertension, dyslipidemia, diabetes, non-alcoholic
fatty liver disease, osteoporosis, and stroke are now classified as metabolic diseases (MDs) [1, 2]. These MDs are
influenced by factors such as unhealthy lifestyles, eating
habits and central obesity, which lead to the disturbance
of metabolic processes and increase the risk of cardiovascular disease [3]. With rising living standards, the prevalence of MDs has significantly increased, posing a major
threat to public health [4]. MDs are influenced by a wide
range of factors, spanning molecular to systemic levels.
At the molecular level, MDs are regulated by various
metabolic enzymes, notably RNA N6-methyladenosine,
which plays a critical role in cellular processes [5]. At
the system level, MDs are intricately linked with comorbidities and socio-health factors, illustrating how both
biological mechanisms and social health determinants
collectively impact these conditions [6–9]. Nevertheless,
these factors alone may not fully explain the high incidence of MDs.
Environmental pollutants, such as particulate matter,
have also been implicated in the etiology of MDs, drawing substantial attention [10, 11]. Existing studies have
established a correlation between MDs and environmental pollutants, particularly air pollutants (APs). A systematic review by Chen et al. [12] reported a significant
correlation between black carbon, zinc, NO3−, SO42−, and
cardiovascular mortality, with prolonged black carbon
exposure notably increasing the prevalence of several
MDs. For instance, asthma prevalence increased by 1.215
times, type 2 diabetes by 1.243 times, stroke by 1.141
times. Zhang et al. [13] found that for every 10.0 µg/m3
increase in long-term ozone exposure, the prevalence of
insulin resistance increased by 1.084 times. Additionally, O3 and PM2.5 exhibited a significant additive interaction on the prevalence of insulin resistance, suggesting
that reducing exposure to these pollutants could alleviate the health and economic burden associated with
chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Furthermore,
Niedermayer et al. [14] identified significant sex differences in the impact of environmental exposure on MDs,
with nitrogen oxides exposure increasing diabetes prevalence by 1.49 times in males but not in females. Despite

accumulating evidence linking APs to MDs, the spatial
distribution of this relationship and its connection to
regional health disparities remain under-explored.
However, the prevalence of MDs is intricately linked
to a multitude of factors, including environmental
exposures, individual lifestyle choices, genetic predispositions, and socioeconomic conditions [15, 16]. The
multifactorial nature of these interactions presents significant challenges for traditional statistical methodologies to elucidate the potential relevance [17, 18]. In
recent years, machine learning (ML) techniques have
been extensively employed to investigate the complex
associations between environmental exposures and MDs,
achieving notable advancements in model interpretability in the meantime. By leveraging interpretable models
such as Random Forests (RF), Decision Trees, and Gradient Boosting Machines, researchers can predict disease outcomes and identify key predictive variables. For
example, Yang et al. [19] utilized Naive Bayes Classifier
and Gradient Boosting Machines to analyze a comprehensive dataset encompassing environmental and socioeconomic factors. Their study elucidated the trends in
cadmium exposure from 1980 to 2040 and forecasted its
future impact on MDs like osteoporosis, diabetes, and
cancers. The RF regression model exhibited robust performance (accuracy = 92.1%) and identified critical predictors of cadmium exposure, including per capita rice
consumption, zinc production, coal consumption, PM10,
lead concentrate production, and urine sample type. This
approach provides a valuable and cost-effective method
for assessing cadmium exposure in populations, particularly in East Asian countries. Wijaya et al. [20] integrated
metagenomic data with seven ML models, including
Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine Linear, and
Support Vector Machine Radial Basis Function, to diagnose and predict petroleum-contaminated groundwater.
Metagenomics reinforced the predictions and interpretability of the ML framework, which shows great promise as a science-based strategy for on-site monitoring and
remediation of environmental pollution. These advanced
methodologies provided a more precise scientific basis
for understanding the intricate relationships between
MDs and environmental exposures, and offered critical insights for future disease prevention strategies and

public health policy development. However, no studies
have used ML methods to explore the spatial relationship
between APs and MDs.
Therefore, this study proposes a novel ML pipeline,
termed ASEMD (Algorithm for Spatial relationships
analysis between Exposome and Metabolic Diseases),
to explore the spatial correlations between specific APs
and MDs. ASEMD addresses the gaps identified in existing research by integrating ML models, epidemiological
statistical methods, and spatial geographical mapping
techniques. The pipeline incorporates methods such
as Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection
(UMAP), K-means clustering, Moran’s I, Local Indicators
of Spatial Association (LISA), linear regression (LR), and
Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Given that diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension are typical conditions
among MDs with high prevalence, we used these diseases
as examples to explore the spatial correlations between
APs and MDs. The key contributions of this work are as
follows:
1. ASEMD highlighted the significant regional impact
of APs on MDs, providing new insights into the environmental exposures associated with MDs, and supporting the development of region-specific health
strategies and interventions.
2. We demonstrated that CO, PM2.5, and NO2 are
strongly associated with the prevalence of diabetes,
dyslipidemia, and hypertension, and the association
between APs and MDs varies spatially across geographic regions.
3. Our study utilized interpretable ML models to identify critical predictors of MDs, improving the accuracy and transparency of environmental health
research.
Through ASEMD, we can analyze the relationship
between APs and MDs on a spatial scale and examine
the interaction between APs and MDs across different regions. The proposed ML framework demonstrates
great promise to be used as a science-based strategy for
preventing and managing MDs.

Materials and methods
Study population

We utilized data from the China Health and Retirement
Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), a large-scale national
cohort study that collects a high quality nationally representative sample of Chinese residents aged 45 and
older across multiple provinces in China. CHARLS is a
longitudinal dynamic cohort study, with the national
baseline survey conducted in 2011. Follow-up surveys
were conducted in 2011, 2013, 2015, and 2018 across 150

Page 3 of 15

counties and 450 communities (villages) in 28 provinces
(including autonomous regions and municipalities) in
China [21]. As CHARLS is a dynamic cohort, a few new
respondents were recruited in subsequent follow-ups. A
more detailed description of the CHARLS dataset has
been previously published in [21, 22].
To align the available data of CHARLS and APs data
from major Chinese cities, [23], we utilized the 2015 data
from the CHARLS cohort. This choice was also made to
ensure that the diagnosis of health outcomes occurred
after exposure to pollution, thereby reducing the bias
introduced by reverse causation to some extent. We
included a total of 19,892 participants who had physical
examination information. Participants were excluded if
they were missing residential location data (at the prefecture level), lived in areas without APs data, or lacked
information on blood lipids, blood pressure, or fasting
glucose. Finally, 19,973 participants were included in this
study. This sample size was determined through power
analysis, ensuring sufficient statistical power to detect
meaningful effects while minimizing the risk of Type II
errors. Furthermore, based on influential demographic
factors identified in the literature, we considered 19
confounding factors, including age, sex, BMI, education
level, marital status, place of residence, mobility status,
smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity [24].
According to the CHARLS study, all participants provided informed consent, and the study received approval
from the Institutional Review Board of Peking University
(IRB00001052-11015).
Diagnosis of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension
Diagnosis of diabetes

The diagnosis of diabetes was based on the following
criteria [25]: fasting plasma glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L, random plasma glucose ≥ 11.1 mmol/L, HbA1c ≥ 6.5%, selfreported diabetes diagnosed by a physician, and the use
of glucose-lowering drugs/insulin treatment. A diagnosis
of diabetes was made if any one of these criteria was met.
Specifically, we utilized the 2015 blood test data from the
CHARLS cohort to obtain values for fasting plasma glucose, random plasma glucose, and HbA1c. Additionally,
we incorporated self-reported diabetes history and treatment status from supplementary questionnaire data to
determine the presence of diabetes.
Diagnosis of dyslipidemia

The diagnosis of dyslipidemia was based on the selfreported history of physician-diagnosed dyslipidemia
and medication use, with a response of “1. Yes” indicating
the presence of dyslipidemia [26].

Liu et al. BMC Public Health

(2025) 25:831

Diagnosis of hypertension

The diagnosis of hypertension was based on the following criteria: self-reported history of physician-diagnosed
hypertension in the questionnaire, with a response of
“1. Yes” indicating hypertension; blood pressure measurements taken during the CHARLS survey, with the
average of three readings taken at intervals of at least
45 seconds using a digital sphygmomanometer (Omron
TM HEM-7200 Monitor, Co., LTD., Dalian, China) as the
diagnostic basis. Diagnoses were made using both the
old standard from the Chinese Hypertension Guidelines
(SBP ≥ 140 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 90 mmHg) and the
new 2023 standard (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg and/or DBP ≥ 80
mmHg); self-reported use of modern medical treatments
for hypertension and/or medication use to control hypertension in the CHARLS questionnaire, with a response
of “1. Yes” to either question indicating hypertension. A
diagnosis of hypertension was made if any one of these
criteria was met [25].
Measurement of air pollutants

In this study, we collected the monthly average concentrations of six APs ( PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3, CO)
from 367 major prefecture-level cities in mainland China
(including municipalities and some autonomous prefectures) from 2013 to 2015, sourced from State Meteorological Administration. Additional APs metrics included
the 24-hour average concentration for each pollutant, the
8-hour average concentration for O3, and the Air Quality
Index (AQI), resulting in a total of 14 APs metrics. The
AQI was calculated according to the “Technical Regulation on Ambient Air Quality Index (Trial)” (HJ 633–
2012), which takes into account the aforementioned six
common pollutants [27].
To ensure the comprehensive integration of environmental pollution information from each region into
our models and analyses, we performed feature extraction. Specifically, for each region and each metric, we
calculated the minimum, maximum, mean, standard
deviation, and quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles)
over the three-year period. Combining these, we finally
derived 98 APs feature values for each region, which were
used as input data for our models.
Algorithm for spatial relationships analysis
between exposome and metabolic diseases (ASEMD)

The ASEMD pipeline aims to uncover geographical associations between environmental factors (e.g. pollutants)
and diseases, identifying specific pollutants closely linked
to MDs prevalence at the regional level. Inputs to the
ASEMD pipeline are two geographically aligned datasets:
pollution indicators and disease prevalence, provided at

Page 4 of 15

various administrative levels (e.g., provincial or prefectural). The details of ASEMD pipeline are illustrated in
Fig. 1.
Initially, the MDs prevalence and 19 individual confounders are extracted from the CHARLS cohort. The
prevalence of MDs will be calculated at the city level and
adjusted by age and gender to obtain the adjusted disease
prevalence. Next, the adjusted disease prevalence and
APs data will be subjected to spatial autocorrelation analysis using Moran’s I index and LISA maps, providing a
foundation for validating the spatial relationship between
APs and MDs.

• x̄ is the mean of the variable.

Moran’s I measures global spatial autocorrelation, where
positive values indicate clustering and negative values
suggest dispersion, with higher absolute values representing stronger associations [28]. LISA maps extend
this analysis locally, identifying regions with patterns
such as high-high (HH), Low-low (LL), high-low (HL) or
low-high (LH), providing a more granular view of spatial
aggregation. HH and LL mean positive spatial autocorrelation, while HL and LH mean negative spatial autocorrelation. Both are used to evaluate whether a certain
variable has a significant spatial aggregation phenomenon in spatial data [29].
Following this, AP data undergo standardization and
dimensionality reduction using Principal Component
Analysis (PCA). Cities are then clustered based on AP
indicators using k-means clustering, yielding k clusters.
Similarly, city-level disease prevalence rates are used to
classify cities into n clusters across various thresholds. By
adjusting both k and n, we form two clustering sets (one
from APs data and one from MDs prevalence). The Jaccard index, calculated as

Jaccard(X, Y ) =

|X ∩ Y |
|X ∪ Y |

, is then used to compare these clusters, with the highest
Jaccard value indicating optimal alignment between APs
and MDs based clustering. In addition, the obtained MDs
prevalence and city cluster labels are represented on the
maps.

Fig. 1 ASEMD pipeline flowchart. The ASEMD pipeline consists of two main datasets: CHARLS and Air Pollutants data. Firstly, the correlation
between APs and MDs is validated from both numerical and visual perspectives using these datasets through Jaccard index and maps. Moran’s I
index and LISA map are applied to examine the spatial autocorrelation of APs and MDs, providing a foundation for understanding their relationship.
Secondly, to identify specific APs associated with MDs, linear regression is performed to obtain adjusted individual air pollutants exposure, which
is then fed into five predictive models. Thirdly, SHAP values are used to identify key APs and interpret the model outcomes

To investigate the impact of APs on MDs at the individual level, we used a linear regression (LR) model, with
various demographic and lifestyle variables as predictors
of individual exposure to aindividual-level air pollution.
Using these adjusted values, five classification models,
eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Decision Tree (DT), Light Gradient Boosting
Machine (LightGBM), Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),
were trained to predict disease prevalence. We applied
a 10-fold cross-validation with a data split of 7:2:1 for
training, validation, and testing. Model interpretability
was provided by Shapley values, which highlighted the
significant associations between the APs of interest and
MDs.
In this study, data preprocessed through the ASEMD
pipeline, along with spatially relevant disease data from
the CHARLS cohort, allow for analyzing the association between APs and three MDs at both prefecture and
individual scales. Disease diagnosis criteria are based
on the CHARLS 2015 data, with prevalence rates ageand sex-standardized across cities to minimize demographic bias. For each disease, prevalence clusters are
divided into high and low groups, with cluster thresholds tested at eight levels (0.6–0.95) and environmental
clusters adjusted from 3 to 7. The optimal combination
of prevalence threshold and environmental cluster count
was determined based on the highest Jaccard index.

Individual-level analysis then incorporated covariates
such as age, gender, BMI, marital status, residence type
(urban/rural), exercise, alcohol use, and smoking (see
Supplementary Table 1). Five classification models were
trained and evaluated through a 10-fold cross-validation
with a 7:2:1 split for training, validation, and test sets,
and model performance was assessed using on accuracy,
AUROC, sensitivity, specificity, precision, and F1 score.
Statistical analysis

For handling missing values in confounders, statistical imputation methods were applied. In general, two
strategies were employed to address missing data. First,
individuals with missing values for any of the considered
variables were excluded from the analysis. Second, when
values for specific variables were missing, appropriate
imputation methods were applied. For continuous variables, the data were first stratified by gender. For those
continuous variables that followed a normal distribution
within each group, missing values were imputed using
the mean, while for those variables not following a normal distribution, the median was used. For categorical
variables, missing values were imputed randomly [30].
Subsequently, continuous variables were standardized
using z-scores, and categorical variables were encoded
using one-hot encoding [31]. The APs data were calculated as the annual mean values, and there were no

Liu et al. BMC Public Health

missing values for the annual mean of the cities considered in the study.
The P-value derived from Fisher’s exact test (calculated
using the stats package) was reported alongside each Jaccard index value, with P < 0.05 indicating a significant
difference between groups. Local Indicators of Spatial
Association (LISA) and the spatial autocorrelation statistic Moran’s I were also calculated, providing insights into
spatial clustering and autocorrelation, respectively. These
calculations were performed using ArcGIS software (version number). The training and evaluation of the LR and
five models were carried out using the xgboost package,
lightgbm package and scikit-learn package, respectively.
Data sorting and other statistical analysis processes were
completed using Python 3.10.

of PM10 exceed those of other pollutants. Among the
MDs, hypertension exhibits the highest national prevalence rate, and diabetes the lowest, and hypertension
is 2–3 times more common than diabetes. Following
age and gender adjustment, there has been a decrease
in the national mean, 25th percentile, 50th percentile,
and 75th percentile prevalence rates for these diseases
(Table 1). Our results are consistent with previous studies, in 2015, the prevalence of hypertension, diabetes and
dyslipidemia was 34.38% [32], 10.9% [33] and 14.1% [34]
in the Chinese population aged ≥45 years, with the highest prevalence of hypertension. There is also study show
that, after adjusting for age and sex, the prevalence of the
diseases decreased [35]. The slightly higher prevalence
of our results may be due to the fact that we included all
older adults over the age of 45 from CHARLS, not just
those aged 45.

Results
Summarised information about APs and MDs

Table 1 enumerates the APs and the prevalence rates of
three MDs, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia, in
367 cities across the nation. It appears that PM10 pollution is significantly more severe on a national scale,
whereas CO pollution is relatively minimal. Over a
24-hour period, the 25th percentile, median, 75th percentile, and maximum values for the average concentrations

Spatial autocorrelation of APs and MDs was reflected
by Moran’s I index and LISA map

In order to explore the spatial correlation between APs
and MDs, we first verify the autocorrelation of all factors of APs and MDs. This study calculated the Moran’s
I index for both, and created maps using LISA map. The
analysis focused on seven major APs, excluding 8-hour

and 24-hour average values. The results showed that all
APs and MDs had significant autocorrelation. In particular, the spatial autocorrelation of PM10 (Moran’s
I index=0.248) in APs is the most significant, while
the spatial autocorrelation of dyslipidemia (Moran’s I
index=0.122) in MDs is the most prominent (Table 2).
The LISA maps of the seven APs and three MDs indicate similar findings (see Supplementary Figure 1 for
other APs and MDs). The prevalence rates of diabetes,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia in the north-central
region exhibit few LL clusters and numerous HL clusters, while the southern regions show few HH clusters
and numerous LH clusters. In some western areas, a significant HH clustering of diabetes prevalence is evident.
Taking the disease with the highest prevalence, hypertension, and the most severe pollutant, PM10, as examples
(Fig. 2), the overall prevalence of hypertension is high in
the north-central region, yet it includes a few cities with
lower rates that cluster together. Conversely, in the southern regions, although the overall prevalence is lower,
there are cities with higher rates clustering together.
Overall, the distribution of hypertension rates in the
north-central and southern regions shows a clear spatial
clustering. Similarly, the distribution of PM10 pollution
in these regions also exhibits similar spatial clustering.
Luo et al. showed that the prevalence of hypertension in
the eastern region of China is the highest (32.6%), followed by the northeast region (31.8%), and the lowest is
the southwest region (20.1%), that is, compared with the
western region, the prevalence of hypertension in the
eastern, central and northeast regions is greater, which is
the same as our results [36]. Another study showed areas

The Z-score is calculated from the Moran’s I index, the expected index, and the
variance, used to test the significance of the Moran’s I index. The Expectation
Index of all variables is −0.008 and Variance is 0.000. A higher Z-score indicates
more significant autocorrelation. The P-value corresponds to the Z-score, with a
P-value less than 0.05 indicating significant spatial autocorrelation. A P-value of

with severe PM2.5 pollution in 2015 were mainly concentrated in western Xinjiang, the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei
region, central and eastern Henan Province, and central
and western Shandong Province [37]. The results of the
distribution of APs are also consistent with the results of
our study. Overall, in the north-central region, cities with
high prevalence rates of MDs tend to cluster together,
while in the southern region, low-prevalence cities are
mainly found near high-prevalence cities. In some western areas, cities with a high prevalence of diabetes also
form distinct clusters. The spatial distribution of APs
such as PM10 exhibits similar clustering patterns.
Spatial correlation of APs and MDs was reflected from two
aspects

After confirming that every variables of APs and MDs
exhibited spatial autocorrelation, we further explored
the spatial correlation between APs and MDs. To determine the optimal number of clusters (m) for geographically related AP indicators, we utilized the Silhouette
Coefficient as the decision metric. The analysis revealed
that the silhouette score was maximized when m = 2
(Supplementary Figure 2). The respective disease prevalence thresholds, maximum Jaccard values, and p-values
are presented in Table 3. With n = 0.6, the highest Max
Jaccard values were observed for Diabetes (0.395), Dyslipidemia (0.377), and Hypertension (0.377), all of which
had statistically significant p-values. (0.006, 0.018, 0.018).
These findings suggested a strong spatial correlation
between these diseases and APs at this threshold. As the
threshold increased to n = 0.65, the Max Jaccard value
for Diabetes decreased to 0.370, but it remained statistically significant (p = 0.008), indicating a continued,
though slightly diminished, geographical association at
this level. Further reductions in Max Jaccard values were
observed for Diabetes at higher thresholds: 0.324 at n =
0.7 (p = 0.031), 0.279 at n = 0.75 (p = 0.039), and 0.266 at
n = 0.8 (p = 0.013). These results suggested a diminishing
spatial relevance as the threshold increases. In summary,
the findings underscored a strong geographic correlation
between MDs and APs at the lower thresholds (n = 0.6
and 0.65), with the spatial association weakening as the
threshold rises.
To illustrate the geographical correlation between
APs and MDs, both variables were integrated and
depicted on a map (Fig. 3). The visualization corroborates the findings presented in the data tables,
demonstrating that cities with elevated rates of MDs
frequently experience more severe air pollution. The
areas most affected by significant air pollution are predominantly located in the northern central parts of the
nation and the selected western cities. The prevalence
rates of diabetes and dyslipidemia are notably higher in

Only categories with a p-value less than 0.05 from the Fisher test were reported

these central-northern cities, whereas southern cities
exhibit lower rates of these conditions. Notably, Jiamusi
reports the highest prevalence of diabetes nationally,
while Cangzhou has the highest rate of dyslipidemia.
Cities across both the northern and southern parts of
the country, including Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Liaocheng, and Yancheng, exhibit high prevalence rates of hypertension. The situation shown on the
map is similar to the LISA map results.
Therefore, the spatial correlation between APs and
MDs is verified from the two aspects of numerical value
(Jaccard Value) and image (geographical map). This
provides a basis for the subsequent verification of spatial associations between specific APs and MDs.

Spatial correlation of specific APs and MDs was reflected
from ML models

To investigate the specific relationships between APs
and MDs, this study first controlled for 19 potential confounding factors, including age, gender, BMI, marital
status, place of residence (rural/urban), physical activity,
alcohol consumption, and smoking. Second, the adjusted
APs data were used as input variables for ML models.
Five classification models-XGBoost, RF, DT, LightGBM,
MLP-were applied to predict the prevalence of diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension. Third, SHAP values
were utilized to identify the top 10 influential APs with
predictive effects for each of the three MDs (Fig. 4). The
results showed that different APs can effectively predict
the prevelence of these MDs (Table 4). Specifically, PM10
had the most significant spatial correlation with diabetes (14.7%), CO with dyslipidemia (44.3%), and SO2 with
hypertension (22.9%).
Overall, the ML models performed well in predicting
the three diseases: diabetes (AUROC = 0.711–0.890),
dyslipidemia (AUROC = 0.706–0.877), and hypertension
(AUROC = 0.603–0.710). Among them, the XGBoost
model performed the best, achieving AUROCs of
0.890 for diabetes, 0.877 for dyslipidemia, and 0.710 for
hypertension.
Sensitivity analysis

To validate the stability of our results, we employed
the ASEMD method and selected the most effective
XGBoost model for our sensitivity analysis. This analysis
was stratified into two main categories: urban-rural population stratification and APs stratification. Across these
strata, all Max Jaccard values exceeded 0.2, indicating a
high level of spatial association (Table 5). In the urbanrural stratification, it was observed that the prevalence of
dyslipidemia and hypertension showed a stronger spatial
association with APs in urban populations. In contrast,
the prevalence of diabetes exhibited a greater correlation with APs in rural populations, with dyslipidemia in
urban areas demonstrating the strongest association. The
pollutant stratification analysis revealed robust spatial
correlations between seven types of pollutants and the
three diseases studied. Notably, PM10 showed the strongest association with all three diseases, and specifically,
the correlation between diabetes and NO2 was the most
pronounced.
Additionally, the AUROC values under both stratification methods were analyzed for the XGBoost model,
which demonstrated excellent performance (Table 6).
Particularly, the adjusted values of APs for age and gender
accurately diagnosed diabetes in rural populations most
effectively. Ozone (O3) performed best in diagnosing all

Page 10 of 15

three diseases, especially diabetes, where it achieved an
AUROC of 0.858.
These results indicate that ASEMD maintained robustness under both urban-rural and APs stratification analyses. Furthermore, the XGBoost model showed high
diagnostic efficacy in both stratification settings.

Discussion
In this study, we employed a novel ASEMD pipeline to
investigate the spatial associations between common
APs and MDs (diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia).
ASEMD utilizes high-dimensional APs data to perform
PCA, K-means clustering, and Jaccard index calculation to evaluate and rank the similarity between pollutant clusters and the actual geographical distribution of
chronic disease prevalence. Additionally, an ML-based
prediction model for the effects of pollutants on chronic
diseases was constructed, thereby assessing the spatial
associations between them in a multi-layered and multidimensional manner. Our findings reveal that there is
a spatial correlation between APs and the prevalence of
diabetes, dyslipidemia, and hypertension, indicating that
regions with relatively higher concentrations of APs also
have higher prevalence rates of these MDs. Moreover,
our results demonstrate that even after accounting for
various demographic and lifestyle confounders, APs can
be effectively modelled to predict an individual’s risk of
MDs while identifying the most significant association
between specific AP and MDs. In detail, PM10 exhibited
the strongest associations with diabetes, while CO were
the most significant pollutants for dyslipidemia. SO2
showed relatively strong associations for hypertension.
Sensitivity analyses that distinguish between regions
and individual pollutants were consistent with the
main findings, suggesting a degree of robustness in our
conclusions.
Our primary findings align with previous research
indicating that APs are associated with MDs and comorbidities, such as cardiovascular diseases. For instance,
particulate matters (including PM1, PM2.5, and PM10)
were important pollutants associated with the three
diseases considered in our study. Previous studies have
shown that they were closely associated with the risk of
MDs such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, diabetes, dyslipidemia, and metabolic syndrome [38–42].
PM10, capable of penetrating and lodging deep in the
lungs, can cause irritation, inflammation, and damage to
the respiratory tract lining, primarily affecting the respiratory system. A toxicological study suggested that PM10
may induce cardiovascular toxicity by elevating ROS
levels in the body [43]. Particulate matter with a diameter of 2.5 micrometres or smaller (PM2.5) is even more
harmful, as it can penetrate the lung barrier and enter

to metabolic syndrome, dyslipidemia, and impaired fasting glucose [46–48]. A review reported that CO exposure disrupted lipid metabolism and increased oxidative
stress, contributing to dyslipidemia, particularly elevated
cholesterol and triglycerides [49]. By binding to hemoglobin, CO reduces oxygen transport, creating an anoxic
environment that promotes fatty acid oxidation [50].
Additionally, long-term exposure to SO2 and other pollutants may affect vascular endothelial function through
oxidative stress, chronic inflammatory response and
other mechanisms [51, 52]. Studies have also demonstrated that exposure to SO2 can directly impact the cardiovascular system by triggering the sympathetic nervous
system, leading to an increase in blood pressure. For individuals already living with hypertension, exposure to SO2
and other APs can exacerbate their condition, resulting in
more pronounced fluctuations in blood pressure [53, 54].
Furthermore, our study underscores the spatial heterogeneity or regional variability in the impact of APs
on MDs. For example, while there is a high correlation
between pollutant clusters and disease prevalence clusters, the spatial map does not display a uniform pattern
of association, indicating that the impact of APs is not
evenly distributed across different regions. We hypothesize that this may be due to variations in the spatial patterns of pollutant exposure and other regional factors.
For instance, the prevalence of hypertension tends to be
higher in northern China, independent of the distribution of APs, which we believe is likely due to factors such
as diet and lifestyle [55, 56]. Additionally, socioeconomic
factors also contribute to this phenomenon, as previous
studies have shown that areas with higher levels of socioeconomic deprivation may suffer greater health impacts
from MDs due to limited access to healthcare, higher
baseline health risks, and greater exposure to APs [57,
58].
Compared to traditional epidemiological methods, this
innovative ASEMD pipeline that we propose has several significant advantages. It allows for a more detailed
analysis of spatial association patterns between exposure
and disease, and the incorporation of individual-level
confounding factors into ML models, thereby mitigating
the influence of more confounders and reducing ecological fallacy to some extent [59]. Traditional epidemiological methods often rely on simpler models that may not
fully capture the spatial complexity of environmental
exposure. They typically focus on relationships at the
individual level (e.g., individual behavior, lifestyle) or at
the regional level (e.g., air pollution and regional disease
prevalence). However, they may overlook spatial correlations. The proposed ASEMD provided a more powerful
framework for understanding the complex relationships
between environmental factors and health outcomes.

This method not only improves the reliability of the
predictions but also enhances the interpretability of the
results.
Nevertheless, it is important to note that our study
has some limitations. First, due to data granularity in
CHARLS, we used data aggregated at the prefectural
city level. Given the relatively size of prefectural cities in
China and the considerable internal heterogeneity, future
research should focus on incorporating finer-grained
data, such as individual health records and personal
exposure assessments, to improve the accuracy of the
analysis and increase confidence in our results. Second,
our study employed a cross-sectional data sampling
method, which limits our ability to draw causal inferences. Furthermore, the covariates included in our study
may not fully cover all risk factors for MDs, which could
affect the robustness of the associations observed in our
research. Finally, there was potential selection bias in the
CHARLS cohort. The dataset predominantly consisted of
older adults (60 years and older) in China, which limited
the generalizability of the findings to younger populations or those with different health conditions. Additionally, since participation was voluntary, it is likely that
individuals with better health or higher socioeconomic
status are under-presented, potentially distorting the
results.

Conclusion
This study presents the ASEMD pipeline as an innovative approach to explore the spatial correlations between
APs and MDs. Our findings underscore the significant
spatial associations between diabetes, dyslipidemia,
hypertension, and various APs, particularly PM10 with
diabetes, CO with dyslipidemia, and SO2 with hypertension. The ASEMD algorithm successfully integrates ML
models, epidemiological methods, and spatial analysis
techniques, providing a robust framework to understand
the complex interactions between APs and MDs. The
results highlight the uneven spatial distribution of these
associations, indicating regional variability. The instability of this spatial correlation is likely influenced by other
factors such as socioeconomic conditions, lifestyle, and
diet. Moreover, the study’s use of interpretable ML models offers valuable insights into the key predictors of MDs
prevalence, enhancing the transparency and reliability of
the findings.
Our findings support the need for targeted, regionspecific public health strategies and interventions, especially in areas with high levels of these APs, to mitigate
the effects of air pollution on metabolic health. Future
research should focus on enhancing the ASEMD pipeline by integrating more fine-grained data, such as individual level pollutant exposures and health records, and
